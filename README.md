# End of Life Announcement

**We are announcing the End of Life (EOL) for the Snyk Nexus Gatekeeper Plugin, effective September 15th, 2025.**

This change is primarily due to Sonatype's discontinuation of Plugin Support. Sonatype, the creators of Nexus
Repository, have officially removed all third-party plugin support in Nexus Repository version `3.78` and newer, which was
released in March 2025.

Here is what you need to know:

* **Impacted Plugin**: Snyk Nexus Gatekeeper Plugin.
* **End of Life Date**: September 15th, 2025.
* **Support until EOL**: We will continue to offer support for leveraging the plugin until September 15th, 2025.
  However, please note that no new enhancements or bug fixes will be released for the plugin during this period.
* **Action Required**: If you are currently using the Snyk Nexus Gatekeeper Plugin, we recommend planning your
  transition to alternative solutions before the EOL date. We encourage you to leverage other Snyk products (such as
  Pull Request Checks or SCM integrations) that can help enhance your security posture and integrate seamlessly into
  your development workflows.

We understand that this change may require adjustments to your current workflows. We encourage you to explore Snyk's
other integrations and features to continue securing your software development lifecycle effectively.

If you have any questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the Snyk support team!
